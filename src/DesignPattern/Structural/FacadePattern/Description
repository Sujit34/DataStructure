Facade Pattern
---------------
The facade pattern is used to help client applications easily interact with the system.

Suppose we have an application with set of interfaces to use MySql/Oracle database and to 
generate different types of reports, such as HTML report, PDF report etc. So we will have 
different set of interfaces to work with different types of database. Now a client application 
can use these interfaces to get the required database connection and generate reports. But when
the complexity increases or the interface behavior names are confusing, client application will 
find it difficult to manage it. So we can apply Facade design pattern here and provide a wrapper 
interface on top of the existing interface to help client application.

Facade Design Pattern Important Points
-----------------------------------------
1. Facade design pattern can be applied at any point of development, usually when the number of 
interfaces grow and system gets complex.
2. Subsystem interfaces are not aware of Facade and they shouldnâ€™t have any reference of the 
Facade interface.
3. Facade design pattern should be applied for similar kind of interfaces, its purpose is to 
provide a single interface rather than multiple interfaces that does the similar kind of jobs.
