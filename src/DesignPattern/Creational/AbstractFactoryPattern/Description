Abstract Factory Pattern
-------------------------
The abstract factory pattern is similar to the factory pattern and is a factory of factories. 
If you are familiar with the factory design pattern in Java, you will notice that we have a 
single factory class that returns the different subclasses based on the input provided and the 
factory class uses if-else or switch statements to achieve this. In the abstract factory pattern, 
we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each subclass and then an abstract factory 
class that will return the subclass based on the input factory class.

Abstract Factory Design Pattern Advantages
------------------------------------------
Abstract Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
Abstract Factory pattern is “factory of factories” and can be easily extended to accommodate more 
products, for example we can add another sub-class Laptop and a factory LaptopFactory.
Abstract Factory pattern is robust and avoid conditional logic of Factory pattern.
